## Bag. 1 : Markdown 

Markdown is the simple and easy-to-use markup language you can use to format virtually any document.

### Pengantar

#### Sejarah Markdown

Markdown is a ightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

#### Cara kerja Markdown

Using Markdown is different than using a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. 

Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

To summarize, this is a four-part process:

1. Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application. The file should have an .md or .markdown extension.
2. Open the Markdown file in a Markdown application.
3. Use the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document.
4. View the HTML file in a web browser or use the Markdown application to convert it to another file format, like PDF.

#### Tujuan Markdown

Depending on the application you use, you may not be able to preview the formatted document in real time. But that’s okay. [According to Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive, so the text in Markdown files can be read even if it isn’t rendered.
